# Immich plugin for Kodi

This plugin aims to provide an interface to the self-hosted photo management solution Immich.

## Installation

As of now installation can only be done by zipping the content of this repository and installing the zip file manually in Kodi.
A valid zip command would be something like this:
```sh
zip -r plugin.image.immich-0.0.1.zip plugin.image.immich
```

## Configuration

Right now there are only two configuration values. The "Server URL" and the "API Key".
A new API key can be generated in Immich this way: "Account settings" > "API Keys" > "New API Key".

## Disclaimer

This plugin is not officially supported by the developers of Immich.

As development of Immich is pretty active right now, changes in Immich-API may come fast.
The developer of this plugin may can't keep up with that tempo as he does it's development in his spare time.

## Troubleshooting

- if installing addon from zip file doesnt work, restart Kodi
